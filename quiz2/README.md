For my database I went through the data of top video games and top games on twitch. I made my own scoring system based on their twitch rank per month (each game was ranked 1-200 per month, so for each month I added 201-theirRank to their score) and then made a new file that adds the game information of the top video games with my score metric from the twitch database added on. The code and files used can be found in the database folder. I also had to add an id that just increments. 

Please wait a bit for the graphs to load. If you PUT or DELETE on all documents the graphs will not work.
